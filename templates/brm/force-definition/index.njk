        <b>What is a force?</b> A force is a push or pull on an object. Forces can be caused by another object 
        pushing or pulling on the object when they are touching each other. There are other forces that act on the object 
        from a distance, including gravity (or gravitational force) and electric forces (if the object has an electric charge).
    </p>

   Let's think about the different forces acting on different objects in examples below:
      <br>

    <div class="text-centered">Example 1:</div>



<div class="text-centered">Example 2:</div>




<div class="text-centered">Example 3:</div>

     
    


    </div>
